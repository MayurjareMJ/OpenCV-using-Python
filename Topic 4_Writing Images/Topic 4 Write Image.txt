CV2 package has imwrite() function that saves an image object to a specified file.

The command to save an image with the help of imwrite() function is as follows −

>>>cv2.imwrite(filename, img)


The image format is automatically decided by OpenCV from the file extension. OpenCV supports *.bmp, *.dib , *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.png,*.webp, *.sr,*.tiff, \*.tif etc. image file types.

import numpy as np
import cv2
# Load an color image in grayscale
img = cv2.imread('OpenCV_Logo.png',0)
cv2.imshow('image',img)
key=cv2.waitKey(0)
if key==ord('s'):
   cv2.imwrite("opencv_logo_GS.png", img)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
